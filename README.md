## What is Snake-NextJS-with-Questions?

Snake-NextJS-with-Questions is an innovative twist on the classic Snake browser game, built using Next.js and React, and integrating key concepts from the field of political anthropology.

## Why Next.js, React, and Political Anthropology?

This project goes beyond a typical browser game by incorporating educational elements. Using React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks, the game dynamically presents questions on political anthropology, turning a simple snake game into an interactive learning experience enabling pausing the game for question intervals. This integration challenges players to not only navigate the snake but also to engage with thought-provoking questions, enhancing their understanding of political anthropology.

This project was not only an exploration into the capabilities of React hooks and Next.js, but also a unique approach to blending gameplay with educational content. The use of Next.js facilitated rapid development, and hosting on Vercel was a seamless choice for a React-based project.
